            <span id="longIntro">My name is Chris Song, a freshman currently majoring in Information Systems with an intended additional major in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, with an international focus throughout my experience in an international school. Before college, I was focused more on learning programming languages through textbooks and by solving online problems. On campus, I am working as a teaching assistant for one of the core programming classes, 15-112. Also, I am expanding my experiences into related areas through working in the web development team for Lunar Gala, or working as a webmaster for Alpha Kappa Psi (Iâ€™ll soon be working on the alumni portal)! Through such experiences, I hope to work in the software engineering industry starting in the near future. I am planning on involving myself further into the realm of computer science, through summer internships/research opportunities.
